# ðŸ§  DSA Practice in Python

This repository demonstrates my foundational **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** preparation as part of my **Data Science interview readiness**.  
It includes Jupyter notebooks that focus on solving core Python problems using **Dictionaries, Lists, Sets, and Strings** â€”  
each designed to strengthen logic-building and problem-solving skills.

DSA-PRACTICE/
â”‚
â”œâ”€ dictionary.ipynb
â”œâ”€ list.ipynb
â”œâ”€ set.ipynb
â””â”€ string.ipynb

```

Each notebook includes:
- Interview-style DSA questions  
- Clean and well-commented Python solutions  
- Output and explanation for better conceptual clarity

## ðŸ’¡ About `.gitignore`
Although this project does not generate any cache or log files,  
a `.gitignore` file is added as a **best practice** to keep the repository clean in the future.

Example:
```

**pycache**/
.ipynb_checkpoints/
*.log

```

This ensures that unnecessary system or temporary files never get pushed to GitHub.

---

## ðŸš€ Future Scope
```
- Add more Python topics like **Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists**
- Add advanced DSA topics for interview-level practice

---
```
